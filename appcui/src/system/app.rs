    /// * `Mouse.Click(x,y,button)` simulates a click (hold an release)
    /// * `Mouse.Move(x,y)` simulates the movement of a mouse to coordonates (x,y). No mouse button are being pressed.
    /// * `Mouse.Drag(x1,y1,x2,y2)` simulates the movement of a mouse from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) while the left button is being pressed
    /// * `Mouse.Wheel(x,y,direction,times)` simulates the wheel mouse being rotated into a direction (one of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) for a number of times. The `times` parameter must be biggen than 0.
    ///
    /// **Key related commands**
    /// * `Key.Pressed(key)` where key can be any combination of keys
    ///

    /// **System events**
    /// * `Resize(width,height)` simulates a resize of the virtual terminal to the size represented by `width` and `height` parameters

    /// **Validation commands**
    /// * `CheckHash(hash)` checks if the hash computer over the current virtual screen is as expected. If not it will panic. This is useful for unit testing.
